# bobbin
Bobbin is a small Unity editor tool that automatically downloads files into your Unity project
- downloads files from any URL, and/or any publicly viewable Google Docs or Google Sheets without any login
- perfect for collaborating with designers, writers, or translators... edit collaboratively in browser, auto-import into your game
- all your settings (URLs and file paths) are saved in a ScriptableObject, convenient for source control
- really lightweight; the core code is just 3 C# files
